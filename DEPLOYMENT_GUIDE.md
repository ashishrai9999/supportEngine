   - **Build command**: `npm install`
   - **Publish directory**: `public`
   - **Functions directory**: Leave empty

## 🔧 Environment Variables (if needed)

If your app needs environment variables:

### Render
1. Go to your service dashboard
2. Click "Environment"
3. Add variables like:
   - `NODE_ENV=production`
   - Any API keys your app needs

### Railway
1. Go to your project
2. Click "Variables" tab
3. Add your environment variables

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **Free Tier Limits**:
   - Render: 750 hours/month
   - Railway: $5 credit/month
   - Vercel: 100GB bandwidth/month
   - Netlify: 100GB bandwidth/month

2. **Your app connects to a backend**:
   - Make sure your backend is also deployed
   - Update the backend URL in your frontend code if needed

3. **CORS**: Your app has CORS enabled, so it should work fine with deployed backends

## 🎉 Success!

Once deployed, your app will be accessible via a public URL. Share this URL with others to test your application!

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **Build fails**: Check that all dependencies are in `package.json`
2. **App doesn't start**: Verify the start command is `npm start`
3. **Port issues**: Your app now uses `process.env.PORT` so this should work

### Need Help?
- Check the platform's documentation
- Look at the deployment logs for error messages
- Make sure your GitHub repository is public (for free tiers)

**Recommended**: Start with **Render** as it's the most straightforward for Node.js apps!
